md stands for markdown, it is the programming language for text written in github.
a commit is when i send my updated version of my fiel to my own local repository. it is not yet updated on the cloud for other users.
branch is when i want to have a few verisons of the same file befoe i decide which them to commit to.
I can add collaborators by going to "settings" - "collaborators" then choosing the username or email and they will receive an email. 

if I find a bug I can make a branch and fix it, then merge the branch to the master.

i can make local changes and then push them to the repository using the terminal or Sourcetree: 
see on the github intro page:
